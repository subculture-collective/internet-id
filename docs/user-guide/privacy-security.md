# Privacy and Security

Learn how Internet ID protects your privacy and secures your content.

## 🔒 Privacy Overview

Internet ID is designed with **privacy by default**:

- 🔐 **Your original files stay private** (unless you choose to upload)
- 🔐 **Minimal data collection** (only what's necessary)
- 🔐 **No tracking** (we don't monitor your activity)
- 🔐 **You control your data** (wallet-based ownership)
- 🔐 **Open source** (audit the code yourself)

## 🛡️ What Data is Stored?

### On Blockchain (Public, Permanent)

**What's stored**:
```
- Content hash (SHA-256 fingerprint)
- Your wallet address
- Timestamp (when registered)
- Manifest URI (pointer to IPFS)
```

**Example on-chain record**:
```json
{
  "contentHash": "0x9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0...",
  "creator": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "timestamp": 1698777600,
  "manifestURI": "ipfs://QmXyz123..."
}
```

**Privacy implications**:
- ✅ Content hash reveals nothing about the file
- ✅ Wallet address is pseudonymous (not tied to real identity)
- ✅ No file content stored on-chain
- ⚠️ This data is public and permanent

### On IPFS (Public, Distributed)

**What's stored**:
```
Manifest (always):
- Content hash
- Your signature
- Optional metadata (title, description)

Original file (only if you opt-in):
- Your entire file
```

**Example manifest**:
```json
{
  "content_hash": "9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0...",
  "created_at": "2025-11-02T00:00:00Z",
  "creator": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "signature": "0xabcdef...",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "My Video",
    "description": "Optional description"
  }
}
```

**Privacy implications**:
- ✅ Manifest hash is derived from content, not personally identifiable
- ✅ You control what metadata to include
- ⚠️ If you upload file to IPFS, it's publicly accessible
- ⚠️ IPFS content can't be deleted (design feature)

### In Our Database (Private, Controlled)

**What's stored**:
```
- Platform bindings (YouTube URL ↔ Content hash)
- Optional: Email (if you sign in)
- Optional: Linked social accounts (if you connect)
- API usage stats (rate limiting)
```

**Privacy implications**:
- ✅ Not stored on public blockchain
- ✅ Can be deleted upon request (GDPR compliant)
- ✅ Protected by standard database security
- ✅ Not shared with third parties

### What We DON'T Store

- ❌ Private keys (you control these)
- ❌ Wallet passwords
- ❌ File contents (unless you opt-in to upload)
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ IP addresses (beyond standard server logs)
- ❌ Analytics beyond essential metrics

## 🔐 Privacy Modes

### Privacy Mode (Default) 🔒

**What happens**:
1. File is hashed locally on your device
2. Manifest is created and signed
3. Manifest uploaded to IPFS
4. Hash registered on blockchain
5. **Original file NEVER leaves your device**

**What's public**:
- Content hash (reveals nothing about content)
- Your wallet address (pseudonymous)
- Manifest metadata (you control what's included)

**What's private**:
- Original file (stays on your device)
- File content (nobody can see it)
- File name (not included in hash or manifest)

**Best for**:
- Unreleased content
- Sensitive material
- Personal files
- Anything you want to keep private

**Example**: Register your unpublished book manuscript. Proves you had it by date X, but nobody can read it unless you share separately.

### Public Mode 🌐

**What happens**:
1. File is hashed locally
2. Manifest created and signed
3. **File uploaded to IPFS**
4. Manifest uploaded to IPFS
5. Hash registered on blockchain

**What's public**:
- Everything in Privacy Mode, PLUS:
- Original file on IPFS (anyone can download)

**Best for**:
- Content you want to distribute
- Public releases
- Open source projects
- Marketing materials

**Example**: Register and upload your music video. Anyone can download and verify it's authentic.

### Which Mode to Choose?

**Use Privacy Mode when**:
- ✅ Content is not yet public
- ✅ You want to keep the file private
- ✅ You only need proof of creation
- ✅ You'll share file through other means

**Use Public Mode when**:
- ✅ Content is already public or will be
- ✅ You want to distribute via IPFS
- ✅ You want one canonical source
- ✅ Permanent public access is OK

**Can't decide?** Start with Privacy Mode. You can always upload later.

## 🔑 Wallet Security

Your wallet is the key to your content ownership.

### Best Practices

**Setup**:
- ✅ Write recovery phrase on paper (not digital)
- ✅ Store in a safe place (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
- ✅ Never share recovery phrase with anyone
- ✅ Use strong, unique password for wallet
- ✅ Enable auto-lock (lock after 5-10 minutes)

**Usage**:
- ✅ Review every transaction before approving
- ✅ Only connect wallet to trusted sites
- ✅ Check you're on the correct website (URL)
- ✅ Disconnect wallet when done (optional but good practice)

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Storing recovery phrase digitally
- ❌ Sharing wallet password
- ❌ Approving transactions without reviewing
- ❌ Connecting to unknown websites
- ❌ Clicking suspicious links in emails/DMs

### What if My Wallet is Compromised?

**If you suspect compromise**:
1. **Immediately create new wallet**
2. **Transfer any funds to new wallet**
3. **DO NOT register new content with compromised wallet**

**Impact on existing registrations**:
- ✅ Already-registered content is still valid
- ✅ On-chain records can't be changed
- ⚠️ Attacker could register new content in your name
- ⚠️ Attacker could bind platform URLs to your content (confuse viewers)

**Recovery**:
- Register new content with new wallet
- Publish your new creator address
- Mark old wallet as compromised (contact us)
- Future feature: Revocation of compromised wallet

### Hardware Wallets (Most Secure)

For maximum security, consider a hardware wallet:

**Options**:
- **Ledger** - Most popular, easy to use
- **Trezor** - Open source, very secure
- **GridPlus** - New, modern interface

**Benefits**:
- Private keys never leave the device
- Protected even if computer is compromised
- Requires physical confirmation for transactions

**Drawbacks**:
- Costs $50-200
- Slightly less convenient
- Learning curve

**Recommendation**: If you're registering valuable or sensitive content, invest in a hardware wallet.

## 🚨 Threat Model

### What Internet ID Protects Against

**✅ Content Theft**:
- Prove you created content first
- Timestamped proof of creation
- Blockchain-backed evidence

**✅ Impersonation**:
- Only you can register with your wallet
- Wallet signature proves identity
- Public verification for all

**✅ Deepfakes**:
- Signal of human-created content
- Provenance trail
- Verification badges

**✅ Platform Censorship**:
- Proof exists even if platforms remove content
- IPFS distribution resistant to takedowns
- Multi-platform bindings preserve evidence

### What Internet ID DOESN'T Protect Against

**❌ Content Accuracy**:
- Internet ID proves WHO created content
- Does NOT prove content is "true" or "accurate"
- Critical thinking still required

**❌ Identity Verification**:
- Wallet address is pseudonymous
- Doesn't prove real-world identity
- Additional verification needed for that

**❌ Copyright Enforcement**:
- Internet ID is evidence, not enforcement
- Legal action still required for copyright violations
- Complements but doesn't replace copyright

**❌ Content Re-upload**:
- Others can still copy and re-upload
- Internet ID helps viewers distinguish original from copy
- But doesn't prevent copying

### Realistic Expectations

**Internet ID is one signal among many:**

**✅ Use it as:**
- Evidence of provenance
- Proof of creation date
- Signal of authenticity
- Complement to other verification methods

**❌ Don't rely on it alone for:**
- Legal identity verification
- Copyright enforcement
- Truth/accuracy claims
- Complete protection against all fakes
