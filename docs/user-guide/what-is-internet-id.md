# What is Internet ID?

Internet ID is a simple way for creators to prove "this is really mine" on the internet—without uploading originals to platforms or trusting a new gatekeeper.

## 🎯 The Problem

In today's digital landscape:

- **AI can fake anything**: Convincing deepfakes of audio, images, and video are everywhere
- **Platform re-encoding**: YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms change your files—bytes shift, quality changes
- **Links rot**: Accounts get compromised, content gets deleted, URLs break
- **No easy proof**: Viewers want a quick signal: "Is this from a real human creator, or is it likely fake?"

## 💡 The Solution

Internet ID gives each piece of content a durable "fingerprint" (a cryptographic hash) and an attestation from you, the creator. That fingerprint is anchored to a public blockchain so anyone can verify it later.

### How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You fingerprint your file** - The app creates a unique digital fingerprint (hash) of your original content
2. **You sign it** - Your wallet signs a manifest proving you created it
3. **It's anchored on-chain** - The fingerprint goes on a public blockchain (like a permanent timestamp)
4. **You connect your links** - Bind your YouTube, TikTok, Twitter posts to your original fingerprint
5. **Anyone can verify** - Viewers can check that your platform content links back to your proven original

Think of it like signing the cover of your work and filing a timestamp at a public archive—so anyone can verify your authorship, anywhere on the web.

## 🚫 What Internet ID Is NOT

### Not a Truth Claim
Internet ID proves **you** created and signed something. It doesn't claim the content is "true" or "accurate"—just that you, the creator, opted in and anchored it.

### Not Copy Protection
This isn't DRM. People can still copy or re-upload your content. Internet ID helps viewers tell the original from imposters.

### Not a Centralized Platform
There's no lock-in. The proof is on an open blockchain. You can verify it yourself, build your own tools, or use ours—your choice.
