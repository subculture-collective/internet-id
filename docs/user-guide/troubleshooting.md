# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common issues when using Internet ID.

## üîç Quick Diagnosis

**Not sure what's wrong?** Follow this checklist:

1. ‚òê Is MetaMask/wallet unlocked?
2. ‚òê Are you on the correct network?
3. ‚òê Do you have sufficient balance for gas?
4. ‚òê Is your internet connection stable?
5. ‚òê Have you tried refreshing the page?
6. ‚òê Is your browser up to date?

If all checked and still having issues, see specific problems below.

## üîê Wallet Issues

### Can't Connect Wallet

**Symptoms**: "Connect Wallet" button doesn't work, wallet popup doesn't appear

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure wallet extension is installed**
   - Check browser extensions
   - Install MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
   - Restart browser after installation

2. **Unlock your wallet**
   - Click the wallet extension icon
   - Enter your password
   - Try connecting again

3. **Refresh the page**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Clear cache if needed

4. **Check permissions**
   - Wallet might have rejected the connection
   - Open wallet ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Connected Sites
   - Remove Internet ID if listed, try reconnecting

5. **Try different browser**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Brave all support MetaMask
   - Some privacy-focused browsers block wallet connections

6. **Update wallet extension**
   - Open extension store
   - Check for MetaMask updates
   - Update and restart browser

**Still not working?**
- Disable other wallet extensions (conflicts can occur)
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

### Wrong Network

**Symptoms**: Transaction fails, content doesn't appear, "Unsupported Network" error

**Solutions:**

1. **Check current network**
   - Look at top-right of Internet ID app
   - Open MetaMask and check network dropdown

2. **Switch to correct network**
   - Click network dropdown in MetaMask
   - Select correct network (e.g., "Base")
   - Refresh Internet ID page

3. **Add network if missing**
   - Internet ID will prompt you to add network
   - Click "Add Network" or "Switch Network"
   - Approve in MetaMask
   - Or add manually from [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org)

4. **Common network names:**
   - Base Mainnet
   - Polygon
   - Ethereum Mainnet
   - Base Sepolia (testnet)
   - Polygon Amoy (testnet)

### Insufficient Balance

**Symptoms**: "Insufficient funds", "Not enough ETH for gas", transaction fails immediately

**Solutions:**

1. **Check your balance**
   - Open MetaMask
   - Look at top (should show ETH or MATIC balance)
   - Need at least $0.10 worth for gas fees

2. **Make sure you're checking correct network**
   - ETH on Ethereum ‚â† ETH on Base
   - Switch to the network you're using
   - Check balance again

3. **Add funds**
   - Buy on exchange (Coinbase, Kraken)
   - Use on-ramp in MetaMask
   - Get test tokens from faucet (testnets only)
   - See [Getting Started - Fund Your Wallet](./getting-started.md#step-3-fund-your-wallet)

4. **Use cheaper network**
   - Switch to Base or Polygon (~$0.01 fees)
   - Instead of Ethereum ($0.50+ fees)

## üì§ Upload & Registration Issues

### File Upload Fails

**Symptoms**: Upload stalls, error message, "IPFS upload failed"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check file size**
   - Web UI: 100MB max
   - For larger files, use CLI tool
   - Or use privacy mode (don't upload file)

2. **Check internet connection**
   - Need stable connection for uploads
   - Try smaller file to test connection
   - Use wired connection if available

3. **Try different IPFS provider**
   - Settings ‚Üí IPFS Configuration
   - Switch from Web3.Storage to Pinata (or vice versa)
   - Or use local IPFS node

4. **Retry upload**
   - Click "Retry" if shown
   - Or refresh page and try again
   - File upload is idempotent (same file = same CID)

5. **Use privacy mode instead**
   - Don't upload file to IPFS
   - Just register the hash
   - File stays on your device

### Transaction Fails

**Symptoms**: MetaMask shows "Transaction failed", "Reverted", or "Out of gas"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check balance (again)**
   - Need gas + small buffer
   - Add $0.10-0.50 worth of ETH/MATIC

2. **Increase gas limit**
   - In MetaMask transaction popup
   - Click "Edit" ‚Üí "Advanced"
   - Increase gas limit by 20%
   - Don't touch gas price (usually)

3. **Check network congestion**
   - Visit network explorer (BaseScan, PolygonScan)
   - If congested, wait 10-30 minutes
   - Or increase gas price

4. **Retry with higher gas**
   - Cancel failed transaction
   - Try registering again
   - MetaMask will suggest higher gas

5. **Switch networks**
   - If Base is congested, try Polygon
   - Or wait for congestion to clear

### Transaction Stuck/Pending

**Symptoms**: Transaction shows "Pending" for many minutes, never confirms

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait first**
   - Base/Polygon: Usually < 30 seconds
   - Ethereum: Can take 5-15 minutes
   - Check block explorer (link in MetaMask)

2. **Speed up transaction**
   - Click pending transaction in MetaMask
   - Click "Speed Up"
   - Approve higher gas fee
   - Transaction should confirm faster

3. **Cancel and retry**
   - Only if stuck for 10+ minutes
   - Click pending transaction in MetaMask
   - Click "Cancel"
   - Approve cancellation (small gas fee)
   - Wait for cancellation to confirm
   - Try registration again

4. **Check nonce issues**
   - Multiple pending transactions can block each other
   - Cancel or speed up the earliest one first
   - Others will follow

### Content Hash Mismatch

**Symptoms**: "Hash doesn't match", verification fails, "Invalid content"

**Causes & Solutions:**

**File was modified:**
- Even tiny changes alter the hash
- Make sure you're using the exact same file
- Check file size and modification date

**Downloaded/re-encoded file:**
- Platforms like YouTube change files
- Use the original file, not downloaded version
- Or use platform binding instead

**File corruption:**
- Re-download or re-export file
- Check file opens correctly
- Use a file integrity tool to verify

## üëÅÔ∏è Content Visibility Issues

   - Content on Base won't show when viewing Polygon
   - Switch wallet to the network you registered on
   - Refresh page

3. **Check connected wallet**
   - Content tied to wallet address that registered it
   - Make sure you're using the same wallet
   - Check address matches

4. **Check transaction confirmed**
   - Visit block explorer (link from MetaMask)
   - Make sure transaction shows as "Success"
   - If pending, wait for confirmation
   - If failed, need to register again

5. **Clear cache**
   - Browser cache might be stale
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear browser cache entirely

### Verification Link Doesn't Work
