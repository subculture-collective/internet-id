# Getting Started with Internet ID

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up Internet ID and registering your first piece of content.

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- [ ] A crypto wallet (we'll help you set this up)
- [ ] A small amount of cryptocurrency for gas fees (we'll explain this)
- [ ] Content you want to register (video, image, audio, or document)

**Don't worry if you're new to crypto!** We'll guide you through each step.

## 🎯 Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

A crypto wallet is like a digital key that proves you own your content. It's free and takes just a few minutes to set up.

### Recommended: MetaMask

We recommend MetaMask because it's secure, widely used, and easy to set up.

1. **Install MetaMask**
   - Visit [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
   - Click "Download" and add the browser extension
   - Or download the mobile app (iOS/Android)

2. **Create Your Wallet**
   - Click "Create a wallet"
   - Set a strong password
   - **IMPORTANT**: Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase on paper
   - Store it somewhere safe (never digital, never share it)
   
   > ⚠️ **Critical**: Your Secret Recovery Phrase is the ONLY way to recover your wallet. If you lose it and forget your password, you lose access forever. Never share it with anyone!

3. **Verify Your Recovery Phrase**
   - MetaMask will ask you to confirm your phrase
   - This ensures you wrote it down correctly

### Alternative Wallets

Other popular options include:
- **Coinbase Wallet** - Great for beginners, integrates with Coinbase
- **Rainbow Wallet** - Beautiful interface, very user-friendly
- **Trust Wallet** - Mobile-first option

## 🌐 Step 2: Choose Your Network

Internet ID supports multiple blockchain networks. Each has different costs and speeds:

### Recommended Networks for Beginners

| Network | Gas Fees | Speed | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Base** | Very Low (~$0.01) | Fast | Most users (recommended) |
| **Polygon** | Very Low (~$0.01) | Fast | Cost-conscious users |
| **Arbitrum** | Low (~$0.05) | Fast | Good balance |
| **Optimism** | Low (~$0.05) | Fast | Good balance |

### How to Add a Network to MetaMask

If you're using **Base** (recommended):

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown (top left)
3. Click "Add network"
4. Click "Add" next to "Base"
5. Approve the network addition

That's it! MetaMask will automatically configure Base for you.

### Getting Test Funds (Free!)

Before using real money, try a test network:

1. **Switch to Base Sepolia** (test network)
   - Network dropdown → "Show test networks" → Select "Base Sepolia"

2. **Get Free Test Tokens**
   - Visit [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-sepolia-faucet)

   - Receive free test ETH in minutes

3. **Try Internet ID Risk-Free**

   - No real money spent!

## 💰 Step 3: Fund Your Wallet (For Real Use)

Once you're ready to register real content, you'll need a small amount of cryptocurrency.

### How Much Do You Need?

- Each registration costs approximately $0.01 in gas fees
